## To do

*   Maybe show CPS-like category (`ConCat.Continuation`, in progress).
*   Perhaps material from second set of notes
*   `CoproductPCat` for `GD k`.
    The "cocartesian rule", a peer to the chain and cartesian rules.
*   Linear maps via representable functors.

## Did

*   `AddFun`
*   Abstract
*   Use infix `(~>)` in place of `k`.
*   Rework `Incremental`.
*   Resolve whether to give the talk at PEPM.
    [Yes](https://popl18.sigplan.org/track/PEPM-2018#Invited-Talks).
*   AD example `cosSinProd`
*   Extracting a data representation: if we use `AddFun`, we have an expensive extraction step e.g., to get the gradient.
*   RAD examples with derivatives as dual functions and as dual vectors: `add`, `fst`, `sqr`, `magSqr`, `cosSinProd`.
*   Get the talk scheduled at work. Wed 3pm.
*   Add `Incremental` to talk.
*   Remarks on symbolic vs automatic differentiation
